                         Jason Fujita was born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii, also known as the melting pot of cultures. From an early age, he was exposed to a variety of music. During elementary school, he had the opportunity to perform hula and play traditional Hawaiian instruments. During the summers, he performed Japanese music on taiko. And during weekends, he studied classical music and theory with his piano teacher. Although seemingly unrelated genres of music, Jason uses his diverse range of musical experiences to meld into his own musical voice.

                         Jason graduated Summa Cum Laude from the Berklee College of Music, double majoring in both film scoring and composition, with a minor in video game scoring. He currently attends the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) for Graduate School, majoring in Composition and Experimental Sound Practices. For his film scoring debut, Jason scored Longing Heart: A Dance Video, a short student film created by Alayna Kobayashi. Since then, he has maintained a strong partnership with Kobayashi, scoring her other works such as Weaving from the Heart: A Lauhala Hat Weaving Documentary, and Hasu. He has also scored other LMU student films such as Elias Ontiveros's The Road Ahead, and Nzinga Murray's Opal City. In the Spring of 2017, Jason made his video game scoring debut as a co-composer and co-sound designer for the USC student project, The Cure to Happiness.
